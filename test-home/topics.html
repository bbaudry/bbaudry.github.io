                                <p>Continuous integration consists in
                                setting up a specific environment to
                                build and test an application. For
                                example, Github actions will spawn a
                                container to run the continuous
                                integration. Github has recently
                                introduced just-in-time runners to
                                mitigate software supply chain attacks
                                on CI [1].</p>
                                <p>In this work, we explore the
                                combination of automatic software
                                diversity [2] and just-in-time runners,
                                to build one-shot unique versions of
                                runners for CI. We will first look at
                                the opportunity of reusing the natural
                                diversity of containers [3], then we
                                will investigate transformations to
                                automatically increase the diversity of
                                runners. The student will explore both
                                github actions and Nix [4] for automatic
                                build.</p>

                                <p>Reprocible builds are essential to
                                build trust in the integrity of packaged
                                artifacts. The Java and Maven
                                communities address this challenge and
                                maintain a list of packages which
                                reproducibility has been verified
                                through independent builds. In this
                                work, we design several strategies to
                                perturb the build to determine the
                                actual robustness of these reproducible
                                builds. These strategies involve
                                randomizing the order of dependencies in
                                the configuration file and perturbing
                                the build environment, such as setting
                                time in the future or changing the
                                system’s language or host name.</p>

                                <p>Build systems are susceptible to
                                supply chain attacks, and Maven is no
                                exception. When Solarwinds’ build system
                                was compromised, the company decided to
                                to introduce software diversity at the
                                core of their build pipelines in order
                                to mitigate future hacks. In this work
                                we investigate the feasibility of
                                introducing diversity in builds for Java
                                project. We study the automatic
                                migration of Maven builds into Gradle
                                builds and then compare the diversity it
                                provides at each build step and what
                                impact this has on the output
                                artifact.</p>

                                <p>An air-gapped computer is one that is
                                not connected to any outside networks.
                                This is used as security measure to
                                protect sensitive data or machines. With
                                the growth of software supply chains,
                                third-party dependencies and continuous
                                integration workflows have become the
                                targets of malicious actors. In this
                                project, we investigate the feasibility
                                of building an environment that supports
                                airgap software builds. In particular,
                                we study to what extent current
                                lockfiles support airgap builds and
                                propose novel solutions to enhance
                                package managers towards better support
                                for airgap security.</p>

                                <p>A key challenge for a robust software
                                supply chain is to ensure the integrity
                                of third-party dependencies. One
                                solution to address this challenge
                                consists in refering to dependencies
                                with content-addressable, immutable URLs
                                instead of mutable URLs as is the case
                                today. We will investigate the
                                Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to
                                store Maven packages and improve the

                                <p>Software-based artworks are
                                performative: the tangible elements of
                                such works are created on the fly when
                                code executes. If the runtime
                                environments of the artwork evolves or
                                even stops being maintained, then the
                                artwork disappears. For example, many
                                artworks from the 2000’s relied on Java
                                applets as a runtime, and now need to be
                                ported to a new environment. The Whitney
                                museum ported its CODeDOC artworks from
                                applets to p5.js. In this work, we
                                explore the ability of Large Language

                                Ethereum. To do so, they publish the

                                for their artwork. The source code is
                                stored on IPFS and is executed each time
                                someone wants to view the piece. When a

                                This software architecture is prone to
                                different risks: the link between
                                onchain data and IPFS can be lost, the
                                javascript environment of the buyer can

                                <p>Pen plotters are programmable
                                machines that can draw and that are
                                currently mostly used by artists who use
                                code as a medium. Plotters are usually
                                used in an artist studio where a
                                computer sends instructions to the
                                machine to draw and where power is
                                readily availabe. For field artists who
                                like to practice and perform in outdoors
                                environment, we wish to build a portable
                                pen plotter. In order to offer the best
                                portability experience, should not need
                                to carry batteries for the plotter or
                                the controller. This is why we also
                                explore energy haresting technology to
                                power the portable pen plotter.</p>

                                <p>The practice of generative art is
                                performative: an artist develops a
                                program, and only when the program
                                executes, i.e., performs, the artwork
                                exists. Consequently, the artwork never
                                exists on a physical memory and one
                                instance can never be seen again. In the
                                current practice of penplotting and
                                generative art, it is usually necessary
                                to save the generated image on disk
                                before it is passed to the pen plotter.
                                This storage of the performed artwork is
                                not elegant in the realm of generative
                                art. In this project, we design and
                                build a system where an image that is
                                performed as part of a generative
                                artwork is streamed live to the plotter,
                                avoiding the generation of the image
                                file and preserving the performing
                                mindset of generative art.</p>

                                <p>Digital art is made to perform in an
                                environment that evolves: OS patches,
                                drivers for interaction, libraries that
                                evolve or even disappear, etc. It is not
                                always possible to update this
                                environment as some elements such as
                                screen resolution, hardware
                                architecture, I/O might not be
                                compatible with latest versions. In
                                order for the artwork to benefit from
                                the latest software patches, they need
                                to be backported to the legacy project.
                                In this project, we explore backporting
                                practices in the specific context of
                                legacy interactive artworks.</p>
