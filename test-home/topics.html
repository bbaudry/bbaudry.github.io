                                <p>Continuous integration consists in
                                setting up a specific environment to
                                build and test an application. For
                                example, Github actions will spawn a
                                container to run the continuous
                                integration. Github has recently
                                introduced just-in-time runners to
                                mitigate software supply chain attacks
                                on CI [1].</p>
                                <p>In this work, we explore the
                                combination of automatic software
                                diversity [2] and just-in-time runners,
                                to build one-shot unique versions of
                                runners for CI. We will first look at
                                the opportunity of reusing the natural
                                diversity of containers [3], then we
                                will investigate transformations to
                                automatically increase the diversity of
                                runners. The student will explore both
                                github actions and Nix [4] for automatic
                                build.</p>

                                communities address this challenge and

                                work, we design several strategies to
                                perturb the build to determine the

                                builds. These strategies involve
                                randomizing the order of dependencies in
                                the configuration file and perturbing
                                the build environment, such as setting
                                time in the future or changing the
                                system’s language or host name.</p>

                                decided to to introduce software

                                <p>JavaScript is the most used
                                programming language for the development
                                of web applications. Once the web
                                application grows, so does the bundle
                                size, primarily due to all its
                                third-party dependencies. A bundler is a
                                tool that transforms all the JavaScript
                                code and its dependencies into a new
                                output file with everything merged
                                (including other files such as HTML,
                                CSS, and PNG). There are many
                                production-ready JavaScript bundlers
                                (e.g., Webpack, Rollup, Browserify,
                                ESbuild, and Parcel). They can perform
                                optimizations and minifications on the
                                bundle, such as tree shaking, scope
                                hoisting, bundle splitting, and
                                minifying. However, the size reduction
                                achieved by a bundler is limited by its
                                own code minimization technique. The
                                student will perform an experimental
                                study to leverage the diversity of
                                JavaScript bundlers in order to reduce
                                the original code size of applications
                                while keeping the functionality required
                                to pass all test cases in their test

                                <p>The large open source software supply
                                chains of many applications have turned
                                open source repositories into targets of
                                choice for the introduction of malicious
                                code. As mature open source projects use
                                continuous integration, stealthy code
                                tampering should also ensure that the
                                test suite passes. While the
                                modification of the test suite might
                                appear as red flag to the open source
                                community, another solution consists in
                                forging the test results. For example, a
                                change in the continuous integration
                                pipeline can turn some failing test
                                cases into passing ones. In this work,
                                we investigate different strategies to
                                forge test suite results in order to
                                mask ill-intended changes in the source

                                property which measures how readily a
                                software component can be replaced by a
                                different but equivalent component. In
                                software supply chains it is critical
                                for faulty or vulnerable components to
                                be replaced as quickly as possible.
                                However, software substitutes might not
                                be immediately available. Generative AI

                                novel test generation techniques that
                                aim at increasing the coverage of a
                                project’s software supply chain. This
                                novel tests shall help in enhancing the
                                dynamic transparency of the supply chain

                                performative: the tangible elements of
                                such works are created on the fly when
                                code executes. If the runtime
                                environments of the artwork evolves or
                                even stops being maintained, then the
                                artwork disappears. For example, many
                                artworks from the 2000’s relied on Java
                                applets as a runtime, and now need to be
                                ported to a new environment. The Whitney
                                museum ported its CODeDOC artworks from
                                applets to p5.js. In this work, we

                                for their artwork. The source code is
                                stored on IPFS and is executed each time
                                someone wants to view the piece. When a

                                different risks: the link between
                                onchain data and IPFS can be lost, the

                                itself. This practice is known as live
                                coding. It can be an individual
                                practice, as well as a group practice,
                                from Seoul to Bogota. The code is
                                written live, projected on screen as an
                                overlay on top of generated images and
                                sound. In this project, we study the
                                programming paradigms and abstractions
                                that live coders use, as well as the
                                code sharing and communities that are
                                involved in this artistic practice.</p>

                                <p>The practice of generative art is
                                performative: an artist develops a
                                program, and only when the program
                                executes, i.e., performs, the artwork
                                exists. Consequently, the artwork never
                                exists on a physical memory and one
                                instance can never be seen again. In the
                                current practice of penplotting and
                                generative art, it is usually necessary
                                to save the generated image on disk
                                before it is passed to the pen plotter.
                                This storage of the performed artwork is
                                not elegant in the realm of generative
                                art. In this project, we design and
                                build a system where an image that is
                                performed as part of a generative
                                artwork is streamed live to the plotter,
                                avoiding the generation of the image
                                file and preserving the performing
                                mindset of generative art. Eventually,
                                the technology can recreate the <a

                                <p>Digital art is made to perform in an
                                environment that evolves: OS patches,
                                drivers for interaction, libraries that
                                evolve or even disappear, etc. It is not
                                always possible to update this
                                environment as some elements such as
                                screen resolution, hardware
                                architecture, I/O might not be
                                compatible with latest versions. In
                                order for the artwork to benefit from
                                the latest software patches, they need
                                to be backported to the legacy project.
                                In this project, we explore backporting
                                practices in the specific context of
                                legacy interactive artworks.</p>

                                <p>libc is at the core of most software
                                stacks, but it is fragile, prone to
                                critical vulnerabilities [1]. In this
                                work we explore a combination of
                                techniques to generate large amounts of
                                diverse implementations of libc [2]. The
                                student will combine the abundant
                                combinations of flags of C compilers
                                [3], with state of the art code
