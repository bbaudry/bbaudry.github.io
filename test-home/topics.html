                                build and test an application. For
                                example, Github actions will spawn a
                                container to run the continuous
                                integration. Github has recently

                                to build one-shot unique versions of

                                diversity of containers [3], then we
                                will investigate transformations to
                                automatically increase the diversity of

                                <p>Reprocible builds are essential to
                                build trust in the integrity of packaged
                                artifacts. The Java and Maven
                                communities address this challenge and
                                maintain a list of packages which

                                work, we design several strategies to
                                perturb the build to determine the

                                can provide enhanced security and

                                system was compromised, the company
                                decided to to introduce software

                                and what impact this has on the output

                                number of third-party libraries. While
                                this massive reuse is beneficial for
                                software development the reuse of a

                                projects (e.g. Log4J) is a security and
                                safety liability. One option to mitigate

                                diversity for debloating JavaScript</h2>
                                <p>JavaScript is the most used
                                programming language for the development
                                of web applications. Once the web
                                application grows, so does the bundle
                                size, primarily due to all its
                                third-party dependencies. A bundler is a
                                tool that transforms all the JavaScript
                                code and its dependencies into a new
                                output file with everything merged
                                (including other files such as HTML,
                                CSS, and PNG). There are many
                                production-ready JavaScript bundlers
                                (e.g., Webpack, Rollup, Browserify,
                                ESbuild, and Parcel). They can perform
                                optimizations and minifications on the
                                bundle, such as tree shaking, scope
                                hoisting, bundle splitting, and
                                minifying. However, the size reduction
                                achieved by a bundler is limited by its
                                own code minimization technique. The
                                student will perform an experimental
                                study to leverage the diversity of
                                JavaScript bundlers in order to reduce
                                the original code size of applications
                                while keeping the functionality required
                                to pass all test cases in their test
                                suites.</p>

                                chains of many applications have turned
                                open source repositories into targets of
                                choice for the introduction of malicious
                                code. As mature open source projects use
                                continuous integration, stealthy code
                                tampering should also ensure that the
                                test suite passes. While the
                                modification of the test suite might
                                appear as red flag to the open source
                                community, another solution consists in
                                forging the test results. For example, a
                                change in the continuous integration
                                pipeline can turn some failing test
                                cases into passing ones. In this work,
                                we investigate different strategies to
                                forge test suite results in order to
                                mask ill-intended changes in the source

                                property which measures how readily a
                                software component can be replaced by a
                                different but equivalent component. In
                                software supply chains it is critical
                                for faulty or vulnerable components to
                                be replaced as quickly as possible.
                                However, software substitutes might not
                                be immediately available. Generative AI

                                <p>Software developers dedicate
                                considerable efforts in implementing
                                strong test suites that exercise and
                                verify the behavior of their project.
                                Yet, developer written tests usually
                                perform poorly when considering the
                                coverage of third-party dependencies.
                                This is because the intention of these
                                tests is not to verify the behavior of
                                dependencies. In this work we explore
                                novel test generation techniques that
                                aim at increasing the coverage of a

                                novel tests shall help in enhancing the

                                performative: the tangible elements of
                                such works are created on the fly when
                                code executes. If the runtime
                                environments of the artwork evolves or
                                even stops being maintained, then the
                                artwork disappears. For example, many
                                artworks from the 2000’s relied on Java
                                applets as a runtime, and now need to be
                                ported to a new environment. The Whitney
                                museum ported its CODeDOC artworks from
                                applets to p5.js. In this work, we

                                Ethereum. To do so, they publish the
                                source code as well as various metadata
                                for their artwork. The source code is
                                stored on IPFS and is executed each time
                                someone wants to view the piece. When a
                                buyer acquires one specific instance of

                                this exact instance are stored on chain.
                                This software architecture is prone to
                                different risks: the link between
                                onchain data and IPFS can be lost, the
                                javascript environment of the buyer can
                                evolve. In this project, we investigate
                                different techniques to mitigate these
                                risks and improve the reproducibility

                                <p>Pen plotters are programmable
                                machines that can draw and that are
                                currently mostly used by artists who use
                                code as a medium. Plotters are usually
                                used in an artist studio where a
                                computer sends instructions to the
                                machine to draw and where power is
                                readily availabe. For field artists who
                                like to practice and perform in outdoors
                                environment, we wish to build a portable
                                pen plotter. In order to offer the best
                                portability experience, should not need
                                to carry batteries for the plotter or
                                the controller. This is why we also
                                explore energy haresting technology to
                                power the portable pen plotter.</p>

                                <p>Digital art is a kind of performance.
                                As long as software runs art is
                                performed. Yet, generative artists
                                approach this performative medium in
                                different ways. Some artists craft the
                                code in their studio and let the machine
                                perform the artwork in a gallery, in a
                                web browser or on the blockchain. Some
                                other artists perform the act of coding
                                itself. This practice is known as live
                                coding. It can be an individual
                                practice, as well as a group practice,
                                from Seoul to Bogota. The code is
                                written live, projected on screen as an
                                overlay on top of generated images and
                                sound. In this project, we study the
                                programming paradigms and abstractions
                                that live coders use, as well as the
                                code sharing and communities that are
                                involved in this artistic practice.</p>

                                <p>The practice of generative art is
                                performative: an artist develops a
                                program, and only when the program
                                executes, i.e., performs, the artwork
                                exists. Consequently, the artwork never
                                exists on a physical memory and one
                                instance can never be seen again. In the
                                current practice of penplotting and
                                generative art, it is usually necessary
                                to save the generated image on disk
                                before it is passed to the pen plotter.
                                This storage of the performed artwork is
                                not elegant in the realm of generative
                                art. In this project, we design and
                                build a system where an image that is
                                performed as part of a generative
                                artwork is streamed live to the plotter,
                                avoiding the generation of the image
                                file and preserving the performing
                                mindset of generative art. Eventually,
                                the technology can recreate the <a

                                environment that evolves: OS patches,
                                drivers for interaction, libraries that
                                evolve or even disappear, etc. It is not
                                always possible to update this
                                environment as some elements such as
                                screen resolution, hardware
                                architecture, I/O might not be
                                compatible with latest versions. In
                                order for the artwork to benefit from
                                the latest software patches, they need
                                to be backported to the legacy project.

                                <p>libc is at the core of most software
                                stacks, but it is fragile, prone to
                                critical vulnerabilities [1]. In this

                                robustness of software systems [1].
                                Through various transformations and
                                randomization, it is possible to
                                automatically generate variants of a
                                program. These variants should have
                                minimal impact on convenience,
                                usability, and efficiency. Meanwhile,
                                each variant should not be sensible to
                                the same bug or vulnerability. In this
                                project, we explore the large-scale
                                diversification of SHA256 [2]. This
                                family of hashing functions is essential
                                for cryptography, and hence a critical
                                feature for security. The student will
                                investigate superdiversification [3] and
                                the composition of multiple
                                diversification techniques, in order to
                                synthesize large amounts of variants for
                                an implementation of SHA256.</p>

                                on the wall without creating valid Perl?
                                This is an essential question at the

                                We will then elaborate on the findings

                                We eventually thoroughly settle the
                                question of whether coffee stains are
                                better Perl programs than paint
