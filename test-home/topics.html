                                <p>Continuous integration consists in
                                setting up a specific environment to
                                build and test an application. For
                                example, Github actions will spawn a
                                container to run the continuous
                                integration. Github has recently
                                introduced just-in-time runners to
                                mitigate software supply chain attacks
                                on CI [1].</p>
                                <p>In this work, we explore the
                                combination of automatic software
                                diversity [2] and just-in-time runners,
                                to build one-shot unique versions of
                                runners for CI. We will first look at
                                the opportunity of reusing the natural
                                diversity of containers [3], then we
                                will investigate transformations to
                                automatically increase the diversity of
                                runners. The student will explore both
                                github actions and Nix [4] for automatic
                                build.</p>

                                <p>Reprocible builds are essential to
                                build trust in the integrity of packaged
                                artifacts. The Java and Maven
                                communities address this challenge and
                                maintain a list of packages which
                                reproducibility has been verified
                                through independent builds. In this
                                work, we design several strategies to
                                perturb the build to determine the
                                actual robustness of these reproducble
                                builds. These strategies involve
                                randomizing the order of dependencies in
                                the configuration file and perturbing
                                the build environment, such as setting
                                time in the future or changing the

                                <p>Build systems are susceptible to
                                supply chain attacks, and Maven is no
                                exception. When Solarwinds’ build system
                                was compromised, the company decided to
                                to introduce software diversity at the
                                core of their build pipelines in order
                                to mitigate future hacks. In this work
                                we investigate the feasbility of
                                introducing diversity in builds for Java
                                project. We study the automatic
                                migration of Maven builds into Gradle
                                builds and then compare the diversity it
                                provides at each build step and what
                                impact this has on the output
                                artifact.</p>

                                <p>A key challenge for a robust software
                                supply chain is to ensure the integrity
                                of third-party dependencies. One
                                solution to address this challenge
                                consists in refering to dependencies
                                with content-addressable, immutable URLs
                                instead of mutable URLs as is the case
                                today. We will investigate the
                                Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to
                                store Maven packages and improve the
                                reproducibility and integrity of Maven
                                builds.</p>

                                <p>Software-based artworks are
                                performative since the tangible elements
                                of such works are created on the fly
                                when code is execute. If the runtime
                                environments of the artworks evolves or
                                even stops being maintained, then the
                                artworks disappear. For example, many
                                artworks from the 2000’s relied on Java
                                applets as a runtime, and now need to be
                                ported to a new environment. The Whitney
                                museum ported its CODeDOC artworks from
                                applets to p5.js. In this work, we
                                explore the ability of Large Language
                                Models at renovating software-based
                                artworks, starting with Java applets
                                artworks to be renovated into pieces
                                that can perform in modern web
