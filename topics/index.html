<p><strong>Fixing yanked releases in npm</strong></p>
<p>Package managers such as npm, rubygems, or cargo support &#8216;<a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues/195">yanking</a>&#8216; a specific release of a package. This can be for for security or legal reasons, or even as a form of protest [3]. Meanwhile, all projects that depend on that release will fail to build when a release is yanked, which can have some catastrophic consequences when the release is massively used [3]. A recent study shows that 9.6% of the packages in Cargo have at least one yanked release [1]. In this project, we analyze the top 10000 npm packages by downloads to determine the amount of yanked releases in the npm ecosystem. We also analyze how the dependen projects fix their build when these releases are yanked.</p>

<p><strong>Debloating Rust programs</strong></p>
<p>The Rust and Cargo ecosystem is growing for low-level programming, thanks to Rust&#8217;s memory safety and comprehensive compiler. It is now a language of choice to develop Kernel features or embedded systems. These applications have drastic constraints on size and it is important that Rust programs are as small as possible.<br />
In this work, we develop novel techniques to reduce bloat in Rust programs, starting from debloating unnecessary crates at build time. </p>

<p><strong>Adversarial rebuild</strong></p>
<p>Reproducibe builds is an essential concept to ensure the integrity of the software supply chain [1]. Yet, setting up an automated pipeline for reproducible builds is extremely challenging because of the numerous platform specificities or randomness sources that can occur in a build. Lamb and Zacchiroli introduced the concept of &#8216;adversarial rebuild&#8217;, which aims at assessing whether a build is actually reproducible. This concept has been implemented for Debian with the reprotest tool that builds the same source code twice in different environments, and then checks the binaries produced by each build for differences.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to determine what are the most sensitive environmental changes that can perturb a reproducible build. We will collect a set of projects that have set up a reproducible build pipeline. Then, we will explore diverse environmental changes and study their effect on the reproducibility of the build. </p>

<p>Air-gapped software development is done by the military and similar highly sensitive environment.

<p><strong>Software integrity with runtime SBOMs</strong><br />
    Supervisors: Benoit Baudry, Martin Monperrus, KTH Royal Institute of Technology</p>
<p>A software bill of material (SBOM) is an inventory of the software components that are reused in an application; e.g third-party libraries. With the growing awareness about the risk of software supply chain attacks, several standards have emerged to compute the static SBOM of an application. This is essential to identify the presence of risky components in the supply chain. Yet, malicious components can be introduced through the compilation and deployment phases. In this project, we investigate the feasibility of collecting the runtime SBOM of an application to mitigate this risk. The student will experiment with and contribute to jbom [2] to provide a sound technique to detect discrepancies between the static and the dynamic SBOM</p>

<p><strong>Embedding the software supply chain at runtime with Java classloaders</strong><br />
    Supervisors: Benoit Baudry, Martin Monperrus, KTH Royal Institute of Technology</p>
<p>In Java, class loading refers to retrieving the binary form of a class or interface and constructing, from that binary form, a class object to represent the class or interface [1]. Today, different subclasses of the `ClassLoader` may implement different loading policies [2]. For example, a class loader may cache the binary representation of a class, prefetch it based on expected usage, or load a group of related classes together. These activities may not be completely transparent to a running application. In this context, determining the third-party suppliers of classes loaded at runtime allows for controlling and hardening the software supply chain of third-party components used during program execution. Monitoring the origins of the “actually” executed code is a critical task for building more reliable and secure systems. The student will design and implement a novel software tool to build a representation of the software supply chain at runtime.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra small code with GraalVM and debloating</strong><br />
GraalVM compiles Java code to native, boosting deployment and runtime performance. Meanwhile, code debloating [2] removes unnecessary code from applications, reducing code size and attack surface. Both techniques are actively researched in the Java ecosystem[2,3]. In this work, we will you use both techniques in conjunction to take code reduction one step further. We will experiment with debloating before, as well as after the GraalVM compilation to understand where the largest code size savings can be performed. Quarkus [4] might be used to reduce one more step.</p>

<p>    <strong>Full-stack debloating for a video conferencing system</strong><br />
    Software bloat is data and code that accumulates over time and yet is not necessary for an application to behave correctly. Several techniques have been proposed over the last years to detect and remove bloat. These techniques complement each other since they analyze bloat at different levels of the software stack (libraries, containers, kernel, etc.). Yet, no previous work has studied the combined effect of these techniques<br />
    For this thesis you will apply different debloating techniques such as DepClean [1], docker-slim [2] and unikernels [3]. You will measure the effects of each technique and their combination on the  <a href="https://github.com/jitsi">jitsi</a> video conferencing system.</p>

<p>    Reproducible builds is an essential property for secure software supply chains [1]. There is ongoing effort in some Linux distributions, in particular Debian, to ensure reproducible builds [2]. In the Java world, there is little work on this topic and no clear understanding of the problem. You will design, perform and analyze an experiment to assess the status quo of reproducible builds in Java and a tool to improve build reproducibility.</p>

<p><strong>Leveraging the diversity of bundlers for debloating JavaScript applications</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript is the most used programming language for the development of web applications. Once the web application grows, so does the bundle size, primarily due to all its third-party dependencies [1,2]. A bundler is a tool that transforms all the JavaScript code and its dependencies into a new output file with everything merged (including other files such as HTML, CSS, and PNG). There are many production-ready JavaScript bundlers (e.g., Webpack, Rollup, Browserify, ESbuild, and Parcel). They can perform optimizations and minifications on the bundle, such as tree shaking, scope hoisting, bundle splitting, and minifying [4]. However, the size reduction achieved by a bundler is limited by its own code minimization technique [3]. The student will perform an experimental study to leverage the diversity of JavaScript bundlers in order to reduce the original code size of applications while keeping the functionality required to pass all test cases in their test suites.</p>

<p>    <strong>Automatic specialization of the Java Runtime (JRE)E</strong></p>
<p>    The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a great, general purpose execution engine, which provides the standard Java libraries.<br />
    Because it is general purpose, it offers too much functionality, when considering only one Java application that runs in the JRE.<br />
    You will design and experiment with a system that automatically specializes the JRE for a specific Java application, using jcov [1] to identify the parts that are necessary and the parts that can be removed. This topic contributes in hardening the software supply chain through debloating [2] and specialization of the software stack [3].</p>

<p>    <strong>Systematic decompilation in the CI to mitigate supply chain attacks</strong><br />

<p>    Supply chain attacks [1] represent a growing threat on software systems, as illustrated by the Solar Winds attack in late 2020 [2].<br />
    One of these attacks consist in tampering with the code at one point in the automatic build pipeline, in order to inject malicious code into the binary.<br />
    In this work, we investigate the systematic disassembly of binary [3], at the end of the build pipeline, to detect the injection of malicious code injection.</p>

<p>    <strong>Detecting superfluous conflicts in Java projects</strong><br />
    Build systems and package manager encourage and support reuse of third-party libraries through a clean declaration of third-party dependencies and an automated build process. Such systems include npm, Maven, Cargo. While reuse and automation are strong software engineering principles, the current use of build systems has introduced some new challenges. One of them is that some developers do not remove dependency declarations from the declaration file, resulting in unnecessary libraries being packaged in the built binary. This can account for up to 40% of libraries [1,2].</p>
<p>    In this project we study the relationship between these unnecessary dependencies and the presence of conflicts in third-party library versions. If a conflict is due to unnecessary dependency, we call it a superfluous conflict. The goal here is to quantify superfluous conflicts over the whole Maven central repository.</p>

    Software bloat emerges in all layers of software stack, from source code, to third-party libraries, build files and containers.<br />
    In this project, we focus on docker-slim [1], a tool that analyzes  applications to determine what it needs, in order to secure and optimize containers.<br />

<p>    <strong>API specialization in Kotlin</strong><br />
    Supervisors: Benoit Baudry, Cesar Soto-Valero, KTH Royal Institute of Technology</p>
<p>    Software applications rely on numerous third-party APIs to reuse existing features (e.g., data processing, security, network, etc.).<br />
    Yet, applications use only a small part of the APIs.<br />
    The unused parts represent unecessary risks for the security and reliability of the applciation.</p>
<p>    In this project, we investigate API specialization to mitigate these risks [1].<br />
    This technique first determinines what are the legitimate usages of an API, to build a sense of self [3] for the application API usage.<br />
    Then, the specialization consists and in building a proxy that blocks all other API usages at runtime.<br />
    This project focuses on specialization for Kotlin APIs [2]. </p>

<p><strong>The natural diversity of fake generation</strong></p>
<p>The automatic synthesis of fakes is a powerful technique for cybersecurity and cyber decoys [1]. The key challenge for this approach is to generate fakes that look-alike real, legitimate artefacts. This is essential so that malicious actors believe that they are collecting real documents. Yet, this is hard, as it requires an automated oracle to determine the &#8216;realism&#8217; of the fake. In this project, we explore the natural diversity of software technology to synthesize different kinds of fake data and documents [2].</p>

    Reuse is essential to build large software applications.

In this work, the student will develop novel techniques to quantify the <em>dependency grip</em> to quantify the actual coupling between an application and its different dependencies.

<p><strong>Forging test results to tamper with open-source projects</strong></p>
<p>The large open source software supply chains of many applications have turned open source repositories into targets of choice for the introduction of malicious code [1]. As mature open source projects use continuous integration, stealthy code tampering should also ensure that the test suite passes. While the modification of the test suite might appear as red flag to the open source community, another solution consists in forging the test results [2]. For example, a change in the continuous integration pipeline can turn some failing test cases into passing ones.<br />
In this work, we investigate different strategies to forge test suite results in order to mask ill-intended changes in the source code.</p>

<p>    Mock objects are highly valuable to create predictable test environments, which speed-up test execution and limit flaky tests. Yet, the development of relevant mock objects is challenging, since there is currently no support to determine the validity or value of manually selected values for mocks.<br />
    You will design a system that observe an application in production in order to collect real program state values that will then be turned into mock objects. This system will leverage efficient observability technology [3] in order to contribute to the state of the art of automated test generation [1,2].</p>

<p>    <strong>From JSON to Java records</strong><br />
    Pankti records program states in production in order to generate differential unit tests that can improve the original test suite of an application [1]. Currently, the states are serialized in JSON, then the generated test includes instructions to deserialize the objects. In this thesis, you will investigate how to generate Java records [2] as part of the test harness. This will make more readable test cases that are not overloaded with deserialization instructions. Java records were introduced in Java 14, and aim to simplify the way we create a POJO (Plain Old Java Objects). </p>

    <strong>Modular: Analyzing test suites in multi-module Maven projects</strong>
    
    Medium to large sized Maven projects tend to leverage a multi-module structure. This allows developers to keep a modular architecture and favors good development practices in collaborative efforts. In this type of project, it is usual that the test suite of one module also specifies code from other modules. Yet, most practical tools to assess the quality of test suites, specifically mutation testing tools, assume that all unit test cases are included in the same module, an assumption that misses the aforementioned practices. This project aims at providing empirical evidence about the interactions between multi-module projects, their test suite and the capacity of test assessment tools.

    <strong>A journey in modern testing suites on Github</strong>
    
    Automatic testing is boosted by a wide adoption of DevOps, continuous integration that runs test suites on every commit and good support for feedback for devlopers, for example through the Github UI. This has triggered the development of a large number of techniques and tools to support developers for writing sophisticated, efficient test suites. These techniques span modern frameworks to specify test assertions, such as <a href="https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a>, advanced test concepts such as property-based testing, for example with <a href="https://github.com/quicktheories/QuickTheories">QuickTheories</a> in Java, or the development of novel virtualization technology to support testing in multiple environment, e.g., <a href="https://github.com/testcontainers">testcontainers</a>. In this work, we explore how these modern techniques and tools for software testing are actually used in open source projects. We aim at finding extraordinary examples of test suites, determining trends in the adoption of certain techniques and in letting software testers from industry and academia have a journey in modern test suites.

<p><strong>Using generative AI to improve software substitutability</strong></p>
<p>Supervisors: Javier Ron, Benoit Baudry, Martin Monperrus</p>
<p>Software substitutability is a property which measures how readily a<br />
software component can be replaced by a different but equivalent component [1].<br />
In software supply chains it is critical for faulty or vulnerable<br />
components to be replaced as quickly as possible. However, software<br />
substitutes might not be immediately available.<br />
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT may be used to efficiently produce<br />
software substitutes in diverse programming languages/paradigms [2].<br />
In this work, we assess the feasibility of using generative AI tools to<br />
enhance substitutablity of components in software supply chains.</p>

    In this project, we explore the large-scale diversification of SHA256 [2]. This family of hashing functions is essential for cryptography, and hence a critical feature for security. The student will investigate superdiversification [3] and the composition of multiple diversification techniques, in order to synthesize large amounts of variants for an implementation of SHA256.</p>

    <strong>Instruction set randomization for WebAssembly</strong>
    
    WebAssembly has been recently proposed as a lightweight bytecode language for the web. It is has designed with high performance in mind. Its instruction set and semantics has been specified as part of a collaboration between the major browser vendors. Since the proposal in 2017, its adoption is growing rapidly. Along this success, security requirements increase.
    
    In this project we explore the adaptation of Instruction Set Randomization for WebAssembly. The idea is generate a randomized WebAssmbly instruction set for each browser and automatically rewrite WebAssembly programs that are launched in this browser. This technology aims at mitigating code injection and code reuse attacks.

    <strong>Harnessing the natural redundancies in fork-based development for automatic diversity</strong>
    
    Recent work has demonstrated the presence of redundant implementation efforts in a fork-based development process [1].

The presence of different solutions that address the same feature is key for the robustness of natural systems. In this project we investigate the opportunity to extract redundant implementations from various forks and use them to build diverse versions of a project.

<p>    <strong>Anatomy of Outlook mail</strong></p>
<p>    Everyday we use extraordinary software objects. Examples of such objects include the Android mobile systems that run on billions of devices, the domain name system that runs the web, or the Outlook email client that lets millions of workers communicate efficiently. These objects are extraordinary in several respects: they are large, they are composed of hundreds of diverse software parts, they evolve fast, they exist in many versions that are tailored to various needs. The massive presence of such objects, as well as the very large dimensions that characterize them are intriguing for software developers and for users. One approach to unveil the extraordinary nature of these objects consists in breaking down all of its components turning into an anatomical analysis of the object [1,2].  </p>
<p>    In this work, we aim at building a fine-grained anatomy of an extraordinary, extremely popular software object: the Outlook email client.</p>

<p>    <strong>Easter egg VM flag</strong></p>
<p>    Easter eggs, sometimes called the final frontier of software development [10]. (Except that of course you can&#8217;t have a final frontier, because there&#8217;d be nothing for it to be a frontier to, but as frontiers go, it&#8217;s pretty penultimate . . .) [269696]. And against the wash of continuous integration a commit hangs, bloated and poetic, one single, cool contribution, gleaming like the madness of gods. Nearly unreal. Reality is not digital, an on-off state, but analog. Easter eggs are for lovers and for the mind. Not enterprise, nor a resurrection, they cherish enchantment and freedom. In the quest for technology and Mastery, you will add an extra mile to the frontier with a new Easter flag for an extraordinary virtual machine [42].</p>

<p>    <strong>Web stalker: deconstructing modern browser technology (remix)</strong></p>
<p>    In 1998, Simon Pope, Colin Green and Matthew Fuller designed the Web Stalker, an alternative web browser that displays the structure of web pages instead of its content [1]. The work was motivated by a strong motivation to understand what happens beyond the screen and to let web users experience this understanding. Twenty years later, the adoption of the web has massively radiated in all aspects of our lives and the complexity of web browsers has exploded.<br />
    This project is about rethinking a web stalker in the era of modern web browsers, going from the design of a solution that leverages the architecture of these browsers [2] to the implementation of an artistic representation of web pages content based on Electron [3].</p>

<p>    <strong>Paint Splatters &#038; Perl Programs (remix)</strong></p>
<p>    In 2019, Colin Mc Millen and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">Tim Toady</a> ran an experiment to answer one question: is it possible to smear paint on the wall without creating valid Perl? This is an essential question at the forefront of art / computing frontier.<br />
    In this project, we will reproduce Mc Millen&#8217;s experiment [1], starting with the curated dataset provided by the authors [2]. We will then elaborate on the findings with original splatters and an exploration of Perl&#8217;s diverse ecosystem [3]. </p>

<h2 id="remix">Remix topics</h2>


    
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix">remix</a> in music and art appropriates and changes other materials to create something new, often as form of tribute to the original material. Through the following research topics we want to explore remix in software research: take a concept, an experiment explored in one context (a specific language, application domain or period in time) and explore it again in another context.
    
    <strong>Remix Descartes in Javascript</strong>
    
    Pseudo-tested methods [1] are dangerous methods: these methods are reached by the at least one test case in the test suite, code coverage is good for these methods and still, if the whole body of the method is removed, no test case notices it. In other words, there exist no test input or test oracle that can trigger or assess a behavior such that the removal of a complete method body is detected. Descartes [2] is an open source tool that can automatically detect pseudo-tested methods in Java projects. The objective of this work is to build a similar tool for Javascript as an extension of Stryker [3].

    <strong>Remix neural decompilation for JVM bytecode</strong>
    
    A decompiler takes compiled code (e.g. x86 code) and produces source code. Decompilation is an essential step for program comprehension, security analyses, etc. However, it is challenging to write an accurate decompiler (that can retrieve the source code that actually corresponds to the compiled code) and the implementation of decompilers currently relies on the careful, manual design of deceompilation rules. Some recent works [1,2] have proposed to use machine learning in order to train a decompiler. These works successfully applied this concept to decompile from binary to C source code. In this work, we wish to remix the exciting concept of decompiler learning for Java bytecode.
