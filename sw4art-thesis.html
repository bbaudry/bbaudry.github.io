        <h2>Code Analysis for software-based artworks</h2>
        <p>
        Software-based art works, such as <a href="https://reas.com/still_life_la/">Still Life</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.ryojiikeda.com/project/datamatics/">datamatics</a>, 
        or <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lozano-hemmer-subtitled-public-t12565">Subtitled Public</a> 
        are made of multiple layers of code to produce the artwork, control light, randomize some parts, fetch data, synthesize sound, 
        control interactions, calibrate projectors, etc. These different layers are made with various programming languages 
        (e.g., Java applets for web-based pieces in the 2000's, javascript, rust, and python for more recent pieces), are optimized for certains 
        resolutions or compiled for certain runtime environments. Consequently, these pieces of art can break over time, 
        because the libraries on which it depends evolve, because runtime platforms change, or because certain technologies disappear (e.g. Java applets).
    </p>
    <p>
        In this work, we investigate code analysis techniques for software-based artworks to build a consolidated body of knowledge about 
        the core libraries, compilers and frameworks used in these artworks; the ability to automatically port them on different platforms; 
        and to design novel techniques to migrate art code to recent architectures or package it into isolated, reproducible containers (e.g., with Webassembly).
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of relevant, state of the art computer science concepts to support digital art include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Code transformation</b>. Many artworks rely on third-party libraries 
                (e.g. <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>>) or APIs (e.g. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a>), 
                which evolve fast. In this project we aim at designing sound source-to-source transformations that 
                support the co-evolution of artworks and their runtime environment.</li>
            <li><b>Containers</b>. A key challenge of digital artworks is to thoroughly document all its runtime dependencies. 
                Recent work explore container-based solution to bundle artworks and their dependencies, make them 
                more reproducible. In this project we study Webassembly to revive old artworks, 
                e.g. <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/codedoc">pieces based on Java applets</a>, and to bundle contemporary browser-based artworks.</li>
            <li><b>Unikernels</b>. When they rely on large sets of dependencies and drivers, a complete setup for an artwork can grow very large.
                Yet, once the artwork is delivered in a gallery, it can live in a close world. This is an opportunity to tailor 
                the artwork's environment to its exact needs and remove large portions of code bloat. In this project, 
                we explore the opportunity of building <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2490301.2451167">unikernels</a> for low-resources artworks.</li>
            <li><b>Energy harvesting</b>. Several artists explore low-fi technology to build robust and sustainable artworks, 
                which can be exhibited outside gallery spaces, e.g. in public outdoor spaces or in natural spaces. 
                In this project, we explore <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:t-eQmwZqGnAJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&scillfp=12560273987587521836&oi=lle">energy harvesting</a> 
                techniques, for the construction of low-power digital artworks.</li>
        </ul>

        The research work will be performed at the <a href="">Université de Montréal</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://softwarediversity.eu/">Benoit Baudry</a>, 
        and in collaboration with artists and museums in Montreal. It can be a Master's or PhD thesis position.
